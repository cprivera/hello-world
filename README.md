# hello-world
Practice getting familiar with using GitHub and it's many features.

My name is Carla Rivera and I'm a freshman CS student at the University of Texas at Austin.
I love coding and the challenges I face while programming and I'm excited to explore more about computer science!
Hopefully at the end of the semester I will be able to put some projects up here like a tumblr blog theme I want to build
and a couple of apps from an Android Development class I am currently attending.
